### Tests for spread (and unspread) lists inside for elements.
>>> Spread list inside for stays on one line if it fits.
var list = [for (;;) ...[1, 2]];
<<<
var list = [
  for (;;) ...[1, 2],
];
>>> Spread list inside for formats like block if it splits.
var list = [for (;;) ...[element1, element2, element3]];
<<<
var list = [
  for (;;) ...[
    element1,
    element2,
    element3,
  ],
];
>>> A split collection that isn't spread wraps and indents.
var list = [for (;;) [element1, element2, element3]];
<<<
var list = [
  for (;;)
    [element1, element2, element3],
];
>>> A split collection that isn't spread wraps and indents.
var list = [for (;;) [element1, element2, element3, element4]];
<<<
var list = [
  for (;;)
    [
      element1,
      element2,
      element3,
      element4,
    ],
];
>>> Force split if loop body is for element.
var l = [for (;;) for (c in d) t];
<<<
var l = [
  for (;;)
    for (c in d) t,
];
>>> Force split if loop body is if element.
var list = [
  for (;;) if (c) d
];
<<<
var list = [
  for (;;)
    if (c) d,
];
