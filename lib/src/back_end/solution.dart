  /// afford to brute force explore the whole tree, even with the optimization

  ///
  /// Most possible solutions add unnecessary splits in regions of the code
  /// that already fit within the page width. Exploring those is wasted time.
  /// To avoid that, we rely on a couple of insights:
  ///
  /// First, the solver treats any piece with an unselected state as being
  /// unsplit. This means that refining a solution always takes a piece that is
  /// unsplit and makes it split more. That monotonically increases the cost,
  /// but may help fit the solution inside the page.
  ///
  /// Therefore, we don't want to select states for most pieces. Only pieces
  /// that need to split in order to find a solution that fits in the page
  /// width or that are necessary because the unsplit state is invalid. (The
  /// latter usually means a line comment or statement occurs inside the piece.)
  ///
  /// So we skip past any pieces that aren't on overflowing lines or on lines
  /// whose newline led to an invalid solution. Further, it's also the case
  /// that splitting an earlier pieces will often reshuffle the formatting of
  /// much of the code following it.
  ///
  /// Thus we only worry about the *first* unsolved piece on the first
  /// problematic line when expanding. If selecting states for that piece still
  /// doesn't help, the solver will work its way through later pieces from those
  /// subsequenct partial solutions.
  ///
  /// This lets us efficiently skip through almost all of the pieces that don't
  /// need to be touched in order to find a valid solution.

  /// this one. It's either a dead end or a winner.
