### Tests for using `factory` to define a constructor.
>>> Factory.
class C {
  factory  (  int  x  )  {  }
  factory  named  (  )  {  }
}
<<< 3.13
class C {
  factory(int x) {}
  factory named() {}
}
>>> Const factory.
class C {
  const  factory  (  int  x  )  {  }
  const  factory  named  (  )  {  }
}
<<< 3.13
class C {
  const factory(int x) {}
  const factory named() {}
}
>>> Const redirecting factory.
class C {
  const  factory  (  int  x  )  =  C  .  named  ;
  const  factory  named  (  )  =  C  ;
}
<<< 3.13
class C {
  const factory(int x) = C.named;
  const factory named() = C;
}
