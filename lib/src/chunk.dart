/// Chunks are created by [ChunkBuilder] and fed into [LineSplitter]. Each
/// contains the data describing where the chunk should appear when starting a
/// new line, how desireable it is to split, and the subsequent text for that
/// line.
///
/// Line splitting before a chunk comes in a few different forms.
///
/// *   A "hard" split is a mandatory newline. The formatted output will contain
///     at least one newline before the chunk's text.
/// *   A "soft" split is a discretionary newline. If a line doesn't fit within
///     the page width, one or more soft splits may be turned into newlines to
///     wrap the line to fit within the bounds. If a soft split is not turned
///     into a newline, it may instead appear as a space or zero-length string
///     in the output, depending on [spaceWhenUnsplit].
/// *   A "double" split expands to two newlines. In other words, it leaves a
///     blank line in the output. Hard or soft splits may be doubled. This is
///     determined by [isDouble].

/// both block-based [indent] and expression-wrapping-based [nesting].
