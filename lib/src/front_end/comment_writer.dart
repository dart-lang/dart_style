/// Functionality used by [AstNodeVisitor], [DelimitedListBuilder], and
/// [SequenceBuilder] to build pieces from the comment tokens between meaningful
/// tokens used by AST nodes.
///
/// Also handles tracking newlines between tokens and comments so that
/// information can be used to preserve discretionary blank lines in places
/// where they are allowed. These are handled along with comments because both
/// comments and whitespace are found between the linear series of [Token]s
/// produced by the analyzer parser. Likewise, both are output as whitespace
/// (in the sense of not being executable code) interleaved with the
/// [Piece]-building code that walks the actual AST and processes the code
/// tokens.
///
/// Comments are a challenge because they confound the intuitive tree-like
/// structure of the code. A comment can appear between any two tokens, and a
/// line comment can force the formatter to insert a newline in places where
/// one wouldn't otherwise make sense. When that happens, the formatter then
/// has to decide how to indent the next line.
///
/// At the same time, comments appearing in idiomatic locations like between
/// statements should be formatted gracefully and give users control over the
/// blank lines around them. To support all of that, comments are handled in a
/// couple of different ways.
///
/// Comments between top-level declarations, member declarations inside types,
/// and statements are handled directly by [SequenceBuilder]. Comments inside
/// argument lists, collection literals, and other similar constructs are
/// handled directly be [DelimitedPieceBuilder].
///
/// All other comments occur inside the middle of some expression or other
/// construct. These get directly embedded in the [TextPiece] of the code being
/// written. When that [TextPiece] is output later, it will include the comments
/// as well.
