  **Note!** This bug means that dart_style 1.1.2 may make semantics changes to
  your strings. You should avoid that version and use 1.1.3.

# 0.2.0-rc.1

* **BREAKING:** The `indent` argument to `new DartFormatter()` is now a number
  of *spaces*, not *indentation levels*.

* This version introduces a new n-way constraint system replacing the previous
  binary constraints. It's mostly an internal change, but allows us to fix a
  number of bugs that the old solver couldn't express solutions to.

  In particular, it forces argument and parameter lists to go one-per-line if
  they don't all fit in two lines. And it allows function and collection
  literals inside expressions to indent like expressions in some contexts.
