**What input code did you provide to the formatter?**

```dart
// Include the code *as text* and not a screenshot.
// Make sure to include the entire surrounding statement
// or declaration since that can affect formatting.
<your original code>
```

**What output did the formatter produce?**

```dart
// Include the actual output here.
<formatter output>
```

**What output did you expect or want the formatter to produce?**

Describe how you expected the formatter to format the code, ideally by showing what you had in mind as code.

```dart
<what you hoped the formatter would output>
```

**Anything else we should know?**

Thanks!
