/// "block-like" formatting of delimited expressions on the right.
///
/// These constructs can be formatted three ways:
///
/// [State.initial] No split at all:
///
/// ```
/// var x = 123;
/// ```
///
/// [_insideValue] If the value is a delimited "block-like" expression,
/// then we can split inside the block but not at the `=` with no additional
/// indentation:
///
/// ```
/// var list = [
///   element,
/// ];
/// ```
///
/// [State.split] Split after the `=`:
///
/// ```
/// var name =
///   longValueExpression;
/// ```
